Sample data description
-------------------------------
Please unzip data.rar to the program data directory

The sample data contains 152967 seismic trace data samples, which are stored in a file in the form of three channels in series. A total of 50989 seismic event waveform data and signs, of which 36,625 are from real seismic events, and the remaining 14,364 are augmented by real seismic usage data Way output.

Data format description:

The data shape is: 50989 * 18001

18000 data bits before the data segment
Data segment 18001 flag

Logo description:
18001 is the data type, corresponding to natural earthquake 0, blasting 1, and collapse 2 respectively.

Data bit description:
Data bits are the first 18000 bits
0-6000: vertical waveform Z
6001-12000: EW waveform of horizontal item
12001-18000: is the horizontal item NS waveform

Each record contains three channels of samples.
